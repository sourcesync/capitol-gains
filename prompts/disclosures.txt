}
2. Any fields that are not applicable should be set to null. (E.g. option_type is only applicable to options, etc.).
3. Note: The asset_codes are usually in square brackets with enums: 4K, 5C, 5F, 5P, AB, BA, BK, CO, CS, CT, DB, DO, DS, EF, EQ, ET, FA, FE, FN, FU, GS, HE, HN, IC, IH, IP, IR, MA, MF, MO, OI, OL, OP, OT, PE, PM, PS, RE, RP, RS, SA, ST, TR, VA, VI, WU
4. Note: The transaction type in the disclosure is denoted either "S" for "sale" or "P" for purchase.
5. If the asset_code is "SP", set the asset code to "ST" if the asset is a stock, or "OP" if the asset is an option.
6. Make sure to convert the dates from mm/dd/yyyy format to %Y-%m-%d format.
7. If the number of shares are not disclosed for an options disclosure, the number of shares is 100 times the number of options.
